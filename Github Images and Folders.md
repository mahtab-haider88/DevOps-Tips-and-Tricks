### Creating Directories/Folders in Github Repositories

There is no direct option available on Github to create directories or folders for repositories.
But the work around I present here works well to create directory.

1. Click on New File.
2. Give a foldername followed by a fileName.
3. Commit.

##### `Note:` You got it right. Create folder would require atleast one file to be created while creating a new folder.

### Adding images into Readme files

There are some scenarios where we want to display few images in our content. Adding images or screenshots in readme.md in Github is useful to present our readme file.
Steps to add images into your content file are as given below:

1. First of all upload your images to Github or any internet based image store/drives.
2. In your github readme file add below content with respective alternate tag and image URL.

    `![alt tag](http://url/to/img.png)`
    
    Example: `![My Sample Image](https://github.com/mahtab-haider88/DevOps-Tips-and-Tricks/blob/master/images/ServerManager.jpg)`
   
 ### Adding Unformatted Text:    
 
 Write text or command within a sentence with single backticks " ` ". The text within the backticks will not be formatted.
